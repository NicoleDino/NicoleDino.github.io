							<h1 class="major">Reflections and Learnings for this course ðŸ“–</h1>
							<p>If I were to reflect on the things that I have learned in this course, I would say that my 
								knowledge has widened so much with regards to every topic discussed here. I learned so many new 
								topics that were all different and advanced for me yet I am glad that I have studied all about it
								and also able to apply all of it in our activities. However, there were times where so many challenges 
								were faced along the way, but despite that, I was able to surpass them by researching how to troubleshoot 
								and also on how to fix particular problems. By that, I was also learning more by solving the errors that I face. Accomplishing this course is a new step towards learning more about my elective, and it is a great privilege to experience performing the activities inside the class since it helps me enhance my abilities with this course. I look forward to the new journey ahead of me in this elective.
